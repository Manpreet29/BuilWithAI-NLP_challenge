This repository contains all code files and data we used in the Global AI Hackathon Challenge Competition titled #BuildwithAI : Emergence. In this project, we utilized web scraping techniques to collect data from multi-platforms, leveraged NLP techniques to process the text data, analyzed the data by sentiment analysis and topic modeling, and created a dashboard to present the results. 

## Motivation
